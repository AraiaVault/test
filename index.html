<h6 class="bob"> If you click the button to the left it will take you to Team Seas. An orginisation where every dollar donated will go to 1 pound of trash removed from our oceans. Even if you don't donate you can still either tell others about Team Seas or you can try removing waste, or not polluting our oceans.</h6>
<h2 class="bill"> There is an estimated amount of 24 TRILLION pounds of plastic dumped into our oceans EVERY YEAR. And that study was in 2020 so it's still counting.
 100 million marine animals die from plastic waste every single year, 100 thousand of those die from being entangled in plastic.
